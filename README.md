# Machine Learning Course Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a control engineering student at K.N. Toosi University of Technology (KNTU), and in this semester, I'm enrolled in the Machine Learning course. This repository serves as a central hub for my homework assignments (HWs) and projects related to the course.

## Repository Contents

- **Homework Assignments (HWs):** You can find all of my machine learning homework assignments in the "HWs" directory. Each assignment is organized in its respective subdirectory and contains the necessary code, documentation, and any related materials.

- **Course Projects:** I will also be working on course projects throughout the semester. The project materials will be located in the "Projects" directory. Each project will have its own directory, including code, documentation, and any other relevant resources.
